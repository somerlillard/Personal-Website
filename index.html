		<p class="about_d1">
			A bit more about me besides my academic status, I'm from a small town called Eden, North Carolina and I love video games, skincare, and the gym.
			At school I'm proudly involved in Semillas de Unidad, Women in CS, and CS+Social Good. As of now I am the most involved in Semillias de Unidad where
			I have the opporunity to give back to the Hispanic community in Chapel Hill by continually fundraising for a local church, tutoring a K-12 student weekly, and
			hosting biweekly Spanish conversation hours on campus to help other students practice their Spanish in a welcoming non-classroom environment.
		</p>
		<p class="about_d2">
			Returning back to the topic of computer science, I'm currently looking for summer 2023 internships and I plan to graduate in May 2023. My favorite
			languages at the moment are Java, HTML, & CSS. Thanks for reading this and getting to know me better! :)
